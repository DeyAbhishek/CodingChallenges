PROCESS :
1. an instance of a program in execution.

2. an independent entity to which system resources(CPU time, memory etc) are allocated.

3. Each process is executed in a separate address space, and one process CANNOT access 
the variables and data structures of another process.

4. if a process wishes to access another process' resources, inter-process 
communications(like, pipes, files, sockets etc) have to be used.

5. process resides in HEAP. 

THREADS :
1. a thread exists within a process.

2. threads of a process shares the process' resources(including its heap space).
So, process can't directly access the memory of another process, but, threads can share the same heap space.
All the threads belonging to a process can read and write the heap memory. 

3. each thread has its own STACK and registers.

4. a thread is a particular execution path of a process. When one thread modifies a process resource, 
the change is immediately visible to the sibling threads.
